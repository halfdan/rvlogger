rvlogger is a re-implementation of vlogger in Ruby

This is a fork of the original RVlogger from Josh Goebel.
His implementation was not complete when compared to the
original vlogger. 

Features in this implementation:
- Database logging (e.g. for per-vhost billing)
- chroot
- Disabling directory creation / logging to a default 
  host if vhost does not exist.
- ErrorLog logging.

Required gems's:
parseconfig

-- Original README --
rvlogger is a re-implimentation of vlogger in Ruby

I was tired of vlogger crashing when directories didn't exist
and I really wasn't in the mood to learn Perl so I just
re-wrote the entire thing (at least the pieces I needed)
in Ruby and rescued some exceptions, and tada, problem solved.
